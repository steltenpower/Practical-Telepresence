Before I go into technological ideas, please also think about what works best for what. And low-tech certainly keeps its role too.

Maybe combine remote-controlled iPad on wheels with recent remote controlled extra arms like in https://www.wevolver.com/wevolver.staff/fusion/master/blob/Overview.wevolver and bidi-video, or have connected video walls faking being a window ?

Faces are not the most interesting all the time, though Zoom/Teams etc are used for that. Maybe seeing what people are doing with their hands is more interesting, or seeing what people are looking at (especially when it's something not on a screen. Put a webcam on your head similar to a miners' lamp? And if you can make a lamp or beamer show shine a frame to know what the camera sees, it might be even more useful.

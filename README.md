# Combined presence
(working together in a mix of physical and virtual)

Before I go into technological ideas, please also think about what works best for what. And low-tech certainly keeps its role too.

Maybe combine remote-controlled iPad on wheels with recent remote controlled extra arms like in [Knowledge for Engineers](https://www.wevolver.com/wevolver.staff/fusion/master/blob/Overview.wevolver) <!-- @tovissy: This link doesn't seem to be working --> and bidi-video, or have connected video walls faking being a window ?

(Stuff you think about when human kind kills itself flying and you work at a thing with buildings an hour apart)

Faces are not the most interesting all the time, though Zoom/Teams etc are used for that. Maybe seeing what people are doing with their hands is more interesting, or seeing what people are looking at (especially when it's something not on a screen. Put a webcam on your head similar to a miners' lamp? And if you can make a lamp or beamer show shine a frame to know what the camera sees, it might be even more useful.

<!-- @tovissy: Wasn't Google Glass all about this? While it failed as a retail product, but is still alive as an enterprise solution https://www.google.com/glass/start/ Also, there are many eyetracking solutions available used in marketing & design researching, that might be repurposed https://imotions.com/blog/eye-tracker-prices/ -->

No tele-presence, but physically together, in a Corona-safe way:
Have a transparent board acting like a 2-sided whiteboard, possibly with a roof on top to guide soundwaves from one side to the other (and keep you dry).
Could also be x-shaped for 4 persons.
Or maybe just open an outdoor with a window and stand on opposite sides.

<!-- @tovissy: This sounds like an intesting idea in the context of large company (which for some reasons still did not transition fully to work-from-home). I was wondering about the costs of such a solution (materials+setup), compared to the cost of an in-place COVID-19 testing unit.  -->
